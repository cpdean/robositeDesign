                    <h2>Your Very Own Robot Tour Guide</h2>
                    		    <p> Do you have a building in dire need of a tour guide? Is it a discerning building for which a simple, lackluster student tour-guide will not suffice? Do you, perhaps, have rolls upon rolls of spare fluorescent orange duct tape laying around? Such is the case for most of America, our research has shown. The Robot Tour Guide is the solution. 
				    <img src="pic/blaze orange.jpg"alt="Through Duck Tape, all thigs are possible."/>
<p> Though the Robot Tour Guide was originally engineered to navigate the trecherous terrain of the third floor of the CMC at Carleton College, there is <b>no</b> terrain too perilous for this rugged piece of machinery. In other words, you too can have your very own Robot Tour Guide. Simply follow these steps... </p>

<p>Firstly, specify the tour area by bounding it using those hundreds of feet ofpesky spare blaze orange tape you have got laying around. This state of the art approach lets the robot know where it should and should not roam. It also functions as a hi-tech communication between man and robot that lets the machines know <b>we</b> are in charge.</p>

<p>Second, take a few pictures from each place the robot might start a tour. Keep all of these images in a folder and note the location of that folder. Then record the motor instructions necessary to complete each tour and save those in a file. Finally, download the Robot Tour Guide Server and run it. You will be prompted for the locations of the various files and folders the robot needs to get to know its new home. And there you are! It's as easy as that*.

<p>*<i>It may not actually be as easy as that.</i></p>
